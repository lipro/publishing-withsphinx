.. rubric:: Known issues

:testing:

   * Because of unknown reason the execution of :literal:`nosetests`
     fails for each :literal:`tox` environment wich has following
     constellation: Sphinx 1.2 and any Python 3
     (:literal:`py{33,34,35}-sphinx1.2`). In a single Python 3 virtual
     environment all is fine.

   * Improfe the unit tests. The current implementation in a single file
     is too simple and inflexible for further tasks. Have a look to the
     Sphinx project and take the best from there.

   * #1: Avoid the deployment of copied DejaVuSans font in
     :literal:`tests/docs/basic/samples/DejaVuSans.ttf`.

   * The integration of Travis-CI is not yet completed and may fail.

:deployment:

   * The release process is completely untested.

:documentation:

   * There is no list of supported Sphinx extensions. A automatically
     representation should be prefered. A appropriate functionality
     should being found.

   * The chapter *Compatibility Matrix* is insufficient. The mapping from
     Sphinx extensions to Sphinx versions is missing. A automatically
     representation should be prefered.

   * There are certainly many spelling mistakes.

.. rubric:: Planned features

:implementation:

  * Provide a differentiated requirement management for all supported Sphinx
    extensions dependent on used versions of Python and Sphinx.

  * Provide a transparent image conversion process from native SVG graphics
    to spezific image formats dependent on used Sphinx writer backend, for
    examples PDF for LaTeX and PNG for HTML.

  * Provide some new Pybtex style formatter to support more (mostly non
    standardized) BibTeX field types.

  * Provide and deploy aditional CSS files to fix selected but faulty HTML
    templates. Maybe we will or have to cooperate with other projects, for
    example :literal:`sphinxcontrib-ansi`.

  * Provide new Sphinx roles to link directly to GitHub and/or BitBucket
    issue tracker.

:documentation:

   * The documentation has to split into different parts: *User's Manual*,
     *Programmer's Manual*, *Regulatory Affairs*, and a *Sphinx Cheat Sheet*.

.. rubric:: Wishlist

:implementation:

   * Provide an specific LaTeX style template or extended the existent to
     support the needs of technical documentations, for example: reference
     or document numbers, project numbers, customized footer / header.

   * Provide harmonized handling for list of tables / figures / equations in
     its own sections or chapters between HTML and LaTeX.

   * Provide a list of todo section similar to the current implementation of
     the bibliography section in LaTeX.

   * Provide a option to influence the footnote handling in LaTeX, for example
     change all footnotes to endnotes. Endnotes should have same manner as the
     bibliography, placed in a separate section or chapter.

   * Support the Sphinx extension :literal:`sphinxcontrib-traceables`.

   * Support the Sphinx extension :literal:`sphinxcontrib-traceability`.
